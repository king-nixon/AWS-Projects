This Bash script: ✅ Lists AWS resources for key services like EC2, RDS, S3, Lambda, CloudFront, IAM, VPC, DynamoDB, and more!
✅ Accepts AWS region and service name as command-line arguments ✅ Uses AWS CLI to fetch and display the resource details ✅ Ensures AWS CLI is installed and configured before execution ✅ Provides structured output for better visibility
Supported AWS Services:
🔹 EC2 Instances

🔹 VPCs
🔹 IAM Users
🔹 Route53 Hosted Zones
🔹 CloudWatch Alarms
🔹 CloudFormation Stacks
🔹 Lambda Functions
