✨ AWS Project: VPC with Public and Private Subnets in a Production Environment 🌐

I am excited to share the successful completion of a comprehensive AWS infrastructure project! This initiative involved designing a highly available, scalable, and secure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) tailored for production environments, while successfully deploying a fully functional application within this architecture.

💼 Project Highlights:

🔹 High Availability and Resilience:

Servers deployed across two Availability Zones for fault tolerance and reliability.
Auto Scaling Groups dynamically adjust resources to handle varying workloads seamlessly.

🔹 Enhanced Security:

Application servers are hosted in private subnets to protect them from direct internet exposure.
Controlled internet access provided through NAT Gateways, ensuring secure external communication.

🔹 Efficient Traffic Management:

Integrated an Application Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic evenly, ensuring fast and reliable user experiences for the deployed application.

🔹 Optimized Network Design:

Implemented public and private subnets for secure communication and seamless data flow between components.
The application is accessible through public subnets, backed by private infrastructure for enhanced security and scalability.
